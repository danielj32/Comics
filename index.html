<h1>The comic</h1>
<p>
The term comic is used to designate those forms of graphic narrative that are assembled on the basis of drawings framed in vignettes. 
Comics can also be known as comics or comic strips depending on the place or region where reference is made to it. 
The comic is an art form that has been popularized especially in the twentieth century although we can find several antecedents of this form of narrative in other times of history.

        The manga begins its life between the years 1790-1912 due to the arrival of people from the West to Japan, and this style of drawing was taking soon more popularity among the Japanese. The manga is born from the combination of two traditions: the Japanese graphic art, a product of a long evolution from the 11th century, and the western comic, entrenched in the nineteenth century.
